## Description
### App Summary
1. A full-stack digital platform for new volunteer signups along with a CRM dashboard to enable staff to administer new programs and enrol new volunteers.
2. This is a pro-bono (proof-of-concept) project done to help a local charity organization to administer volunteers' signup, as well as manage its programs more efficiently. A simple process streamlining was performed to migrate some of the manual taskes commonly performed by staff to a digital platform.
3. Tech stacks - ReactJS with TypeScript, React Query, Tailwind CSS, Spring-Boot and Spring Security + Firebase Auth.
4. Deployment pipeline - GitHub, AWS code pipeline and AWS MySql RDS.
5. App in test environment (on port 8080) is using H2 in-memory database.
